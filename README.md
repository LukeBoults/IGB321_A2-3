Hello and welcome to Time Gardener!

In the far future the  majority of the planet’s plant life has gone extinct. As a solution scientists have sent Herb-ii, an advanced robot, back in time to collect samples from the greenery of the past. Their  goal is to eventually bring enough plants forward in time to restore the Earth’s broken biosphere.

You assume the role of this time travelling botanist, Herb-ii who has been tasked with retrieving crucial seeds of the past from Ancient Babylon circa 500 BC, which was selected thanks to its famous hanging gardens.  

However as an advanced construct from the future, Herb-ii must avoid any contact with the citizens of the past lest he cause damage to the established timeline. To do this he must stick to the rooftops and make use of his trusty jetpack and parkour skills to remain out of sight.
